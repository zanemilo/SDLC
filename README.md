    # How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs involves gathering detailed requirements from stakeholders and translating them into actionable tasks. Creating user stories helps by clearly outlining these requirements in a user-focused manner, ensuring the development team understands and prioritizes them effectively. This approach enhances communication, maintains focus on user value, and allows for flexible adjustments.

    # How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Approaching program development involves planning, designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software iteratively. I aim to incorporate Agile processes like Scrum for structured sprints, CI/CD for efficient deployments, and user stories for clear requirement management. These processes ensure adaptability, frequent delivery of value, and continuous improvement.

    # What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
